# mpg-regression-model-streamlit
📘 MPG Prediction System — Developed by Tejal Wankhade

A Streamlit-based machine learning web application that predicts a car’s Miles Per Gallon (MPG) based on its features.
This app uses a pre-trained regression model (Autompg_model.pkl) built using the Auto MPG dataset.

🚗 About the Project

This application allows users to input car specifications such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and more — and instantly get an estimated fuel efficiency (MPG) predicted by the ML model.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

Data preprocessing

Model training & evaluation

Saving and loading ML models

Deploying ML models into an interactive Streamlit app

🧠 Features

✔ Predict MPG using a trained regression model
✔ User-friendly Streamlit interface
✔ Accepts both manual inputs and CSV uploads
✔ Supports batch predictions
✔ Clean UI with helpful instructions
✔ Model built and deployed by Tejal Wankhade
